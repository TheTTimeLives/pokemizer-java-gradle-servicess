# To Do

* Migrate spring profile stuff to be handled at the repository level when pipelines get worked on
* Figure out why certain dependencies will not load in Eclipse, but will in IntelliJ. Documentation for Eclipse seems all over the place and there's a hidden .classPath file for Eclipse that I think may not have the extra dependencies on it (they were certainly being downloaded)
* Figure out why ./gradlew dependencies or ./gradlew dependencyInsight doesn't work and what I have to do to run a --configuration flag with that and why
